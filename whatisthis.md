Hello Everyone,

This is a simple experiment in the ocean of Data Analytics.
I have written a paper on 'Sentiment Analysis of Twitter: A Case Study using Naive Bayes Algorithm'. This was also published in an IEEE Conference.

Sentiment Analysis basically is a part of Data Analytics where you collect data from the tweets(not neccesarily twitter, it can also be youtube or any other social media platform where you post how you felt about a recent change in your life)
The case study I took up was Demonetisation and GST in India.
I collected tweets, and using text blob and Naive Bayes Algorithm classified tweets according to their polarity and subjectivity.
